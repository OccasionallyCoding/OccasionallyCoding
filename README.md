### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**OccasionallyCoding/OccasionallyCoding** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my Github Portfolio
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Data Science on the Google Cloud Platform
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open source projects that have a positive impact on the environment, web3, crypto, games
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with my projects (âœ¨coming soon!âœ¨)
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about how to use GitHub, what my favorite thing to do is, and what I would like to do for the rest of my life!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: comment on my README.md and I will provide my LinkedIn!
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: just call me Jordy ðŸ˜‰ 
- âš¡ Fun fact: I live in North America
