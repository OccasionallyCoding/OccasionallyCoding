### Hi there 👋

<!--
**OccasionallyCoding/OccasionallyCoding** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my Github Portfolio
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Data Science on the Google Cloud Platform
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects that have a positive impact on the environment, web3, crypto, games
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with my projects (✨coming soon!✨)
- 💬 Ask me about how to use GitHub, what my favorite thing to do is, and what I would like to do for the rest of my life!
- 📫 How to reach me: comment on my README.md and I will provide my LinkedIn!
- 😄 Pronouns: just call me Jordy 😉 
- ⚡ Fun fact: I live in North America
